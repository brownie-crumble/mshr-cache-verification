# MSHR-Based Non-Blocking Cache Verification

This project simulates and verifies a non-blocking, direct-mapped cache implemented in Verilog with dual Miss Status Handling Registers (MSHRs). The design supports read and write operations, handles concurrent cache misses via MSHRs, and includes assertion-based checks and waveform-based debugging.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- **Dual-MSHR support** for concurrent miss tracking
- **Read/Write request support** with cache fill handling
- **Corner case testing**: hits, misses, MSHR full scenarios
- **Assertions** to check timing and MSHR correctness
- **Waveform debugging** using EPWave/GTKWave
- **Fully automated testbench** with task-based interface
